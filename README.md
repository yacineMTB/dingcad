## Dingcad

Dingcad is a live reloading program that is a replacement for openscad. Becuase openscad kind of really sucks. Try ./run.sh and then updating scene.js

This is dingcad. Dependencies: raylib, manifoldcad, and quickjs. Ask an LLM how to set up raylib on your system. For the quickjs and manifoldcad; you can 

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This repository is mostly autonomously written by an LLM that I've lazily prompted while watching youtube and hanging out with my family.
